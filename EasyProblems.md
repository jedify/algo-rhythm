## Easy Problems

####1. Two Sum
   Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.<br>
   You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
   Hint: Process each, put it in a map with index, check for target-value is present return else empty <br>

####2. Reverse Integer
   Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0
