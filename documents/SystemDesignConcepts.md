#### BASE(Basically Available Soft-State Eventually) - Eventual Consistency: ####
    **_BASE_** essentially embraces the fact that true consistency cannot be achieved in the real world, and as such cannot be modelled in highly scalable distributed systems. BASE has roots in Eric Brewer's Consistency, Availability and Partition-tolerance (CAP) Theorem, and eventual consistency is the underpinning of any distributed system that aims to provide high availability and partition tolerance.
